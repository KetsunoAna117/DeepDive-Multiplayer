# DeepDive - Multiplayer
Introducing the second version of DeepDive, an iOS game that elevates the diving experience by allowing users to play multiplayer with their friends. Developed using SpriteKit and Multipeer Connectivity, this app supports real-time synchronization of character movements between two devices, ensuring a smooth and immersive gameplay experience.

This project, a part of our Nano Challenge 2 at the Apple Developer Academy, showcases our efforts to create a compelling and interactive game. Our goal was to impress with a well-coordinated diving adventure that highlights the technical capabilities of SpriteKit and real-time device synchronization.

## Technologies Used

- **Spritekit:** For rendering 2D graphicss
- **Multipeer Connection:** For handling connection between 2 devices
- **SwiftUI:** For building the user interface with a declarative Swift syntax
